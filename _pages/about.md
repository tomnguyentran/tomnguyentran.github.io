My journey into Fintech didn't start with code. It started with a PAX terminal and a stack of chargeback receipts.

While working in Merchant Operations, I handled merchant onboarding and resolved friendly fraud disputes. At the time, I didn't even know I was working in Fintech. 

After I finished my Data Science studies, I began learning about the world of payment processing and fraud. That's when I discovered that I had already lived through the problems that this industry is trying to solve with data.

I realized that combining my technical background with my experience in Merchant Operations created the perfect foundation for data analytics in Fintech. I am also a member of the TAG Fintech Society to keep up with the latest trends in the industry.
