💳 My journey into Fintech didn't start with code. It started with a PAX terminal and a stack of chargeback receipts.

While working in Merchant Operations, I handled merchant configurations through MIDs and resolved friendly fraud disputes. At the time, I didn't even know I was working in Fintech. 

🎓 After I finished my Data Science studies, I began learning about the world of payment processing and fraud. That's when I realized that I had already lived through the problems that this industry is trying to solve with data.

Previously, I taught kids Python and helped them understand technical concepts in the simplest way possible. That experience taught me clear communication can make or break how someone connects with a new idea.

💡 I felt like this mix of domain interest, communication, and coding skills was a great way to pivot to data analytics in FinTech. I am also a member of the TAG Fintech Society to keep up with the latest trends in the industry.
