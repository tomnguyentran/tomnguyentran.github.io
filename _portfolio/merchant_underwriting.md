# Project Background
A merchant acquirer is scaling its operations, receiving a surge of 2,000 merchant applications representing over $108 million in potential processing volume.

However, the company's manual underwriting team has become a critical bottleneck. Relying on manual human review for every application delays
revenue for legitimate businesses while increasing the risk of human error on high-stakes decisions.

This project builds an automated underwriting decision engine using SQL and Python. By implementing a logical decision funnel,
the system is designed to instantly approve safe merchants while automatically blocking $38 million in exposure from high-risk and prohibited applicants.
